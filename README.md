Dude, I just finished watching Until Dawn, and omg, what a rollercoaster. I mean, seriously, my heart's still racing. It’s like one minute you're all cozy, and the next you’re freaking out about wendigos. Like, who even came up with this stuff?? Anyway, I didn’t see half the twists coming. I'm sitting here like, wait, how did I not predict any of this? 

> You know what I mean when you just wanna yell at the screen like “DON’T GO IN THERE,” but obviously they do, and then someone almost dies, and you’re like, “Why don’t I have popcorn?” It’s always the moments where you think it's chill that something insane happens. It’s like the universe having a little laugh at our expense.  

Btw, at one point I was thinking, hey, wouldn’t it be cool if I could download the movie and just catch every little detail I missed? Cuz like, that dialogue at times was way too subtle for my sleepy brain. But legit, I felt so invested in those characters, even the ones I wanted to slap for being dumb sometimes. Haha, you get it, right?

And the whole atmosphere of it, just wow, so creepy. When they're just trying to survive, and you’re rooting for some of them way more than others. 😅 Also, side note, I probably should've watched the movie with the lights on, would've saved me some mini heart attacks. But who am I kidding, I always say that and never do it.

var nonsenseCode = I don't know, man, felt like it needed a touch of random; 

Just feels good to rant about it, like getting it all out of my system. Let's chat more soon, I wanna hear your take if you’ve seen it. I need someone to confirm I’m not losing it over here! 😂
